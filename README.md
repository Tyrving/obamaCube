# obamaCube
Repo for the Obama Cube Simulator. Written in Processing for Java.

Currently, JOGL(Java OpenGL) has issues with macOS and NSWindows stuff that should be fixed in 2.4, which has not been released yet. BEcause of this, I cannot export proper OSX .app files. 

Windows should work just fine.

If anything does not work as intended, please install processing (processing.org) and run the .pde source code there.

You will need to install java for any binaries to work, unless specified otherwise.
